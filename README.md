After working with some modbus devices at my day-job, I decided to create a simple tcp/ip server that commmunicates via the modbus protocol.
Modbus is a protocol commonly used by industrial devices and PLCs for data acquisition. It was established in 1979 by Modicon, and is still
quite prevalent today despite its age.

TODO:
1) Finish read commands for holding and input registers
2) Add error handling response codes
